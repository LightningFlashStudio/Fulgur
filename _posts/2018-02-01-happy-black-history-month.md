# Happy Black History Month

For this wonderful month I'll be posting something about black history each day. However, I'd just like to leave a few quotes from some of my personal heroes. I hope you enjoy!

"Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom"
    -- George Washington Carver.

"Free at last, Free at last, Thank God almighty we are free at last."
--Martin Luther King Jr.

"Either America will destroy ignorance or ignorance will destroy the United States."
    -- W.E.B. Du Bois

"If you don't stand for something you will fall for anything."
-- Malcolm X

"Racism is still with us. But it is up to us to prepare our children for what they have to meet, and, hopefully, we shall overcome."
-- Rosa Parks

"Liberate the minds of men and ultimately you will liberate the bodies of men."
-- Marcus Garvey

"I would fight for my liberty so long as my strength lasted, and if the time came for me to go, the Lord would let them take me."
-- Harriet Tubman

"I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and to incur my own abhorrence."
-- Frederick Douglass

"Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.
If you're walking down the right path and you're willing to keep walking, eventually you'll make progress."
-- Barack H. Obama

"The time is always right to do what is right."
-- Martin Luther King Jr.
