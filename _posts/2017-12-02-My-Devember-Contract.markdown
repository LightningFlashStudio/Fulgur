<b><p>I, Gai, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be learning Javascript. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise.</p></b> 

<p>This Devember I will learn Javascript through w3schools online tutorial (https://www.w3schools.com/js/) and I will upload my code to this repo. I find although I'm comfortable with HTML and CSS I can't write javascript very well. I would like to change that this month.</p>
